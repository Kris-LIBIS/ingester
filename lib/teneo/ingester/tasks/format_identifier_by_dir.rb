                    This task will perform the format identification on each FileItem object in the ingest run. It relies completely
                    on the format identification algorithms in Libis::Format::Identifier. If a format could not be determined, the
                    MIME type 'application/octet-stream' will be set and a warning message is logged.

                    Note that this task will first determine the formats of all files in the given folder and subfolders (if deep_scan
                    is set to true). It will then iterate over each known FileItem to find the matching file format information. The
                    upside of this approach is that it requires the start of each of the underlying tools only once for the whole set
                    of files, compared with once for each file for the FormatIdentifier. It will therefore perform significantly
                    faster than the latter since starting Droid is very slow. However, if there are a lot of files, this also means
                    that the format information for a lot of files needs to be kept in memory during the whole task run and this
                    task will be more memory-intensive than it's file-by-file counterpart. If there are also a lot of files in the 
                    source folder that are ignored, these will also be format-identified by this task, resulting in a significant 
                    overhead.

                    You should therefore carefully consider which task to use. Of course this task will only be usable if all source
                    files are stored in a single folder tree. If the files are disparsed over a large set of directories, it makes
                    no sense in using this task to format-identify the whole dir tree and the FormatIdentifier task will probably
                    be faster in that case.
